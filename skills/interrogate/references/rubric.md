# Review Rubric

Review through whichever lenses are relevant. Not every lens applies to every change. Use judgment.

## Correctness

Does the code actually do what the intent says it should?

- Edge cases: empty inputs, nil/undefined, boundary values, concurrent access
- Error handling: are errors caught, propagated, or silently swallowed?
- Off-by-one, type coercion, integer overflow, string encoding
- State management: race conditions, stale closures, dangling references
- Does the happy path work? Does the sad path work?
- Idempotency: what happens if this operation runs twice, or if a previous run crashed halfway? If the answer is "it depends on what state was left behind," there's a missing reconciliation step.
- Concurrency: if multiple actors can touch the same mutable state (files, branches, shared data), is access serialized structurally (locks, sequential phases, exclusive ownership), or by conventions that won't hold?

When you find a potential bug, trace the execution path. Don't just flag "this could be nil". Show the call chain that makes it nil.

## Root Causes vs. Symptoms

Is the code fixing the actual problem or papering over a symptom?

Answering this often requires looking beyond the changed files. Read the surrounding code (callers, callees, type definitions, sibling modules) and understand the architecture the change lives in. Use the tools available to you (Read, Grep, Glob) to explore. Follow the call chain. Read the types. Understand why the code exists before judging whether the change addresses the right layer.

- Guard clauses that mask a deeper invariant violation
- Retry logic that hides a broken contract
- Type casts that silence a modeling error
- If you see a workaround, ask: why is the workaround needed? What would a proper fix look like?
- A fix in module A that should really be a fix in module B's contract
- Instructions where structure would be better: if the fix is a comment saying "don't do X" or a convention someone has to remember, ask whether it could instead be a type constraint, a lint rule, or a runtime check that makes the wrong thing impossible

## Over-Engineering and Proportionality

Does the change introduce more machinery than its current requirements and reachable risks justify? Apply the selected Minimize Reader Load principle; do not reward defensive complexity merely because it can be rationalized in the abstract.

- For every new abstraction, layer, guard, validator, fallback, retry path, configuration option, extension point, compatibility path, or state transition, identify the concrete requirement, reachable execution path, or material risk that requires it.
- Challenge code built for hypothetical callers, future implementations, impossible internal states, or failures that cannot be traced from a real boundary.
- Check whether defensive code hides a violated contract, duplicates validation already guaranteed by construction, or creates more states, branches, tests, and failure modes than it prevents.
- Treat security, data integrity, destructive behavior, concurrency, and unreliable external boundaries as legitimate reasons for defensive design when the relevant path and risk are concrete.
- Prefer deletion, inlining, or the direct implementation when correctness and clarity remain at least as strong.

Flag unjustified machinery as a finding. Do not wait for it to cause a correctness bug, and do not propose a larger abstraction as the default remedy.

## Verification

Can you tell that this code works from reading it?

- Are there tests? Do they test behavior or implementation details?
- Are there assertions/invariants that would catch regressions?
- If this is a bug fix: is there a test for the bug?
- If this touches an integration boundary: is the full path tested?
- Check the real thing, not a proxy: if the code checks liveness via file mtime or cached state instead of reading the actual value, that's a verification gap.
- For delegated or async work: does the code verify actual output artifacts, or does it trust self-reports and summaries?

## Security

Only flag security issues you can actually trace through the code. "This could be an injection vector" without showing the input path is not useful.

- User input flowing to dangerous sinks (SQL, shell, eval, innerHTML) without sanitization
- Authentication/authorization gaps in new endpoints
- Secrets in code, logs, or error messages
- TOCTOU (time-of-check-time-of-use) in security-critical paths
